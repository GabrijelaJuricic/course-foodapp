# course-foodapp

## About

This is a project I worked on as a part of a React course. It's a simplified version of a food ordering application and my main goal was to connect all the components and manage all the states correctly. It's not finished yet, as you will notice by clicking the "Order" button in the Modal component - it simply console logs a message.


## Installation instructions

Since this is a simple React project, all that's needed to run the project locally is to:
- download or clone this repository into a folder
- run ```npm install```
- run ```npm start```
