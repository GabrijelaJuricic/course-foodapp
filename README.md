# Food app

## Project description

This is a project I worked on as a part of a Udemy React course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. It's a simplified version of a food ordering application and my main goal was to connect all the components and manage all the states correctly. By clicking the "Order" button in the Modal component - it simply console logs a message.
